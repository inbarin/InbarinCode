So, you want to find some level I beat?

It's very simple, there are 2 routes.

Route A (recommended for Windows computers / wherever tkinter exists):
1. Install python on your computer. (sorry, cant help with that)
1.b. If interested, you may also install the "pyperclip" library for extended functionality (like copy-pasting items / searching strings).
2. Run "python list.py" inside this folder.
3. Navigate the list.

Route B (not recommended, but works universally):
1. Get some form of Json viewer.
2. Beutify the file.
3. Minimize everything / selectively.
4. Navigate the list.

Navigating the list (Using the python script):
1. Click any of the items in the list.
2. Use the Right arrow to open for subitems.
3. I'm sure you can understand the rest of the arrow keys yourself, it's just a treeview window element (fancy name for "big list").
